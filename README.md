## Meme Generator App - React

This is a client application which consumes [Meme Api](https://imgflip.com/api) to generate random meme images. It also has inputs to print optional texts on the image.

My motivation building this application was to cultivate my fundamental [React](https://reactjs.org/) knowledge while following best practices.

Some topics I have covered:

- Event listeners
- State
- Conditional rendering
- Form controls
- Side effects

Technologies:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)

Live [demo](https://meme-generate-app.netlify.app/).

To run this application in development mode:

#### `npm install`

#### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
